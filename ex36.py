****** Welcome to Demple Escape ******

You are standing at the entrance to the hidden temple.

Do you wish to:
1. enter the temple
2. run away like a baby 
""",
    "first_chamber":"""
You are in the first chamber.  A large stone now blocks the entrance behind you.
A small stone statue stand before you.

Choose:
1. take statue
2. go deeper into the temple
""",
    "long_hall":"""
You are in a very long hall lit by torches.
You notice that some of the stones are slightly darker than the rest.

As you walk down the hall, do you:
1. avoid the dark stones
2. step only on dark stones
3. walk carelessly without paying attention
""",
    "treasure_chamber":"""

You have found the treasure chamber!

All around you are piles of gold and precious gems.
In the center of the room is a huge diamond.

What do you do?
1. do not touch the huge diamond but take everything else you can carry
2. grab the huge diamond first
3. take only gold
4. exit through the doorway on the far side of the room without taking anything
""",
    "exit":"""
Congratulations! You found the exit and survived the temple!
Unfortunately you did not collect any treasure.

Enjoy the rest of your life!
